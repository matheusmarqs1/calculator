    * **Dynamic Rounding**: Intelligently rounds numbers to fit within a 16-character display limit.
    * **Exponential Notation**: Automatically switches to scientific (exponential) notation (`e+`) for very large or very small numbers to ensure readability and fit the display.
    * **Clean Output**: Removes unnecessary trailing zeros for a polished look.
